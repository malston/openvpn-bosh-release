Advanced Settings
=================

There are a few additional options available which are intended for advanced configuration. Here are some examples of them...

Share Intranet
--------------

In case you want to allow VPN clients to access a network accessible by the OpenVPN server.

::

    properties.openvpn.push_routes:
      # tell clients they can reach 10.10.0.0/16 through the VPN
      - "10.10.0.0 255.255.0.0"

IP Tables
---------

You can configure IP table rules which will be added on start-up and removed on shut-down.

::

    properties.openvpn.iptables:
      # allow VPN traffic to talk to the main network
      - "POSTROUTING -t nat -s 192.0.2.0/24 -d 10.10.1.0/24 -j MASQUERADE"
      # allow VPN traffic to talk to a specific server
      - "POSTROUTING -t nat -s 192.0.2.0/24 -d 10.10.2.100/32 -j MASQUERADE"

Client-specific Configuration
-----------------------------

You might need to assign a specific IP address to a specific VPN client...

::

    properties.openvpn.ccd:
      -
        # this is the "common name" from the certificate they're using to connect
        - "myspecialclient"
        # these are the "client-specific-directives" to push to the client
        # in this case, the client will be assigned the VPN IP of 192.0.2.101
        - "ifconfig-push 192.0.2.101 255.255.255.0"

Extra Configurations
--------------------

Use ``extra_config`` to include otherwise-unconfigurable properties for the OpenVPN server.

::

    properties.openvpn.extra_config: |
      client-to-client
